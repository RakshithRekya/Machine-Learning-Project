ðŸ§¾ Linear Regression Project â€” E-Commerce Data Analysis

ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project is based on a regression analysis task from Kaggle, focusing on an E-Commerce company in New York City that sells clothing online and offers in-store style sessions.
The company wants to decide whether to prioritize improvements in their mobile app or their website experience. Using customer behavior and spending data, this project applies Linear Regression to identify which platform drives higher customer spending and engagement.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To analyze customer data and build a predictive model that helps the company determine whether they should focus on their mobile app or website for increasing revenue.

ðŸ§  Key Steps

Data Exploration â€“ Understanding customer spending patterns and correlations between features.
Data Visualization â€“ Using plots to find relationships between time on app, time on website, and yearly spending.
Model Building â€“ Applying Linear Regression to predict yearly customer spending.
Model Evaluation â€“ Interpreting coefficients and assessing model performance using metrics such as RÂ² and MAE.

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

Python 
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

ðŸ“ˆ Results

If all the coefficients are positive, it means that an increase in any feature will result in an increase in the target variable, Yearly Amount Spent. 
Hence, the company should focus on both their website and app experience to maximize customer spending.
