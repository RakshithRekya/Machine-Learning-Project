🧾 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Project

📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify data points based on their proximity in feature space. The dataset contains numerical features representing measurements or attributes, and a binary target variable — “TARGET CLASS” — indicating the class label for each instance.
The main objective is to build and evaluate a KNN classification model that can accurately predict the target class for new, unseen data.

🎯 Objective

To apply the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classifying data points based on similarity, and to evaluate the model’s performance using key classification metrics.

🧠 Key Steps

Data Exploration – Reviewing data structure and feature distributions.
Feature Scaling – Applying standardization to ensure all features contribute equally to distance calculations.
Model Building – Training a KNN classifier and tuning the k value for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation – Using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report to assess results.
