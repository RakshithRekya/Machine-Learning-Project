🧾 Logistic Regression Project — Advertising Click Prediction

📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on their demographic and online behavior data. The dataset includes user information such as daily time spent on site, internet usage, area income, and age. Using Logistic Regression, this model helps understand what factors influence the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad — providing insights for optimizing marketing strategies and audience targeting.

🎯 Objective

To build a classification model that predicts if a user will click on an ad, helping the marketing team identify which user segments are more likely to engage with advertisements.

🧠 Key Steps

Data Exploration – Analyzing patterns and relationships between user features and ad-click behavior.
Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing data for model training.
Model Building – Applying Logistic Regression to classify users as “Clicked” or “Not Clicked.”
Model Evaluation – Assessing accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

📈 Results

The Logistic Regression model successfully identifies patterns between user behavior and ad clicks. The analysis reveals that user age, daily site time, and internet usage are strong predictors of ad-click likelihood.

💡 Learnings

Practical experience with Logistic Regression for binary classification.
Improved understanding of model interpretation and evaluation metrics.
Real-world application of data preprocessing and visualization.
